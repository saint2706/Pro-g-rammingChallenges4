# requirements.txt for Games folder
# Only Python games with external dependencies are listed here; pins follow the canonical repo versions.

# General (for all Python games)
# Standard-library-only games do not require extra packages.

# For games using numpy (e.g., Sudoku generator/solver)
numpy>=1.26,<2.0              # Grid math utilities – planned extra: games-core

# For games using matplotlib (e.g., Shuffle/cards.py)
matplotlib>=3.8,<3.9          # Plotting for statistics/visualizations – planned extra: games-visuals

# For games using sound (Simon mini-game)
pygame>=2.6,<2.7              # Optional sound support – planned extra: games-audio

# For games using tkinter (GUI titles such as Simon, Snake)
# tkinter ships with most Python installs; install separately on Linux if missing.

# Future pyproject extras will expose groups such as "games-core" and "games-audio" covering these needs.
