# Random Name Picker

## Problem Statement
Select one or more names uniformly or with optional weights from a list, supporting reproducibility, replacement rules, and JSON output for integrations.

## Usage
- Pick three unique names from the default list:
  ```bash
  python rnp.py --count 3
  ```
- Allow repeats (sampling with replacement):
  ```bash
  python rnp.py --count 5 --with-replacement
  ```
- Produce deterministic selections and JSON output:
  ```bash
  python rnp.py --count 4 --seed 42 --json
  ```
- Compare theoretical weights against simulated draws and render charts:
  ```bash
  python rnp_visualizer.py --count 2 --trials 200 --seed 7 --json --no-show --save wheel.png
  ```
  The visualizer reports normalized probabilities, runs deterministic Monte Carlo
  draws when seeded, and can save matplotlib pie/bar charts for quick sanity
  checks.

## Debugging Tips
- If no `names.txt` exists, the script can create one automaticallyâ€”verify contents before running weighted draws.
- Test suite command:
  ```bash
  pytest test_rnp.py
  ```
  It covers weight parsing, replacement rules, and deterministic seeding.
- Pass `--log DEBUG` to print parsed weights and confirm totals when debugging bias issues.

## Implementation Notes
- Dataclass configuration validates requested counts against the number of available names when sampling without replacement.
- Supports `name,weight` lines for weighted random selection (fallback to weight 1 when omitted).
- Uses Python's `random.Random` seeded instance to keep deterministic runs isolated from global state.
