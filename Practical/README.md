# Practical Projects Suite

A curated collection of small-to-medium Python (and some multi-language) utilities, demos, and learning projects. Each folder under `Practical/` is intentionally selfâ€‘contained so you can explore a single topic (networking, image manipulation, GUIs, CLI patterns, simple web apps) without heavy project scaffolding.

This root README gives you:

- A highâ€‘level map of the subprojects
- Quick setup (global vs perâ€‘tool) guidance
- Usage examples (PowerShell oriented â€“ you're on Windows)
- Common architectural / code patterns used across tools
- Contribution & extension tips

> New here? Skim "Quick Start" then jump to a project that interests youâ€”each script has inline docs and many have their own README or helpful comments.

## 1. Quick Start

### 1.1. Clone and enter

```pwsh
git clone https://github.com/saintwithataint/Pro-g-rammingChallenges4.git
cd Pro-g-rammingChallenges4/Practical
```

### 1.2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```pwsh
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1   # PowerShell activation
```

### 1.3. Install consolidated dependencies

This installs everything needed for ALL tools (heavier, but simple):

```pwsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Want minimal installs? See "Selective Installs" below.

### 1.4. Run something

```pwsh
python "Imageboard/imageboard.py" --help
python "Seam Carving/resize.py" --help
python "ToDoList-CLI/todo.py" add "Ship awesome README"
```

## 3. Selective Installs

If you only need a subset, install manually:

| Feature | Minimal Install |
|---------|-----------------|
| Imageboard | `pip install Flask Pillow` |
| Seam Carving | `pip install opencv-python numpy` (Pillow optional for GUI) |
| IP Map | `pip install requests pandas plotly tqdm` |
| IRC Client | no extra packages (Python 3.10+ standard library) |
| PDF Tagger | `pip install pypdf` |
| ASCII Converter | `pip install Pillow numpy` |
| Vector / Rotating Cube | `pip install matplotlib numpy` |

You can also break the monolithic `requirements.txt` later into extras (see "Future Improvements").

## 4. Common Patterns & Conventions

- Dataclasses: Configuration + domain objects (`TodoItem`, `CarveConfig`, etc.).
- Escapeâ€‘thenâ€‘format: For safe HTML injection (Imageboard `format_post` filter).
- GUI Separation: Logic modules importable by GUI (`resize.py` vs `resize_gui.py`).
- Atomic Writes: For todo storage to avoid corruption.
- Thread Cancellation: Event/flag based graceful shutdown (seam carving GUI, scanners).
- CLI Consistency: Most scripts provide `--help` and exit codes >0 on error.
- Optional Imports: Graceful degradation if heavy libs absent.

---

## 5. Usage Examples

A few representative workflows.

### 5.1. Imageboard (development run)

```pwsh
python "Imageboard/imageboard.py" --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000 --data data_dev
# Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Uploads go into `data_dev/uploads/`; SQLite DB stored in `data_dev/imageboard.db`.

### 5.2. Seam Carving

```pwsh
python "Seam Carving/resize.py" input.jpg --width -200 -o resized.jpg --progress
```

Negative width means remove columns; use `--height` similarly. GUI:

```pwsh
python "Seam Carving/resize_gui.py"
```

### 5.3. Port Scanner (top 1000 default ports)

```pwsh
python "Port Scanner/scanner.py" 192.168.1.10 --top 1000 --json report.json
```

GUI:

```pwsh
python "Port Scanner/scanner_gui.py"
```

### 5.4. ToDo List

```pwsh
python "ToDoList-CLI/todo.py" add "Refactor imageboard quoting"
python "ToDoList-CLI/todo.py" list --all
python "ToDoList-CLI/todo.py" done 3
```

### 5.5. Markov Chain Sentences

```pwsh
python "Markov Chain Sentence Generator/mcsg.py" corpus.txt --order 3 --sentences 5
```

GUI:

```pwsh
python "Markov Chain Sentence Generator/mcsg_gui.py"
```

### 5.6. Relational DB (SQL shell)

```pwsh
cd "Relational DB"
python -m relational_db.cli
```

Sample session:

```sql
db> CREATE TABLE authors (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
db> INSERT INTO authors VALUES (1, 'Octavia Butler');
db> SELECT * FROM authors;
id | name
1  | Octavia Butler
```

### 5.6. ASCII Conversion

```pwsh
python "ImgToASCII/convert.py" cat.png --width 120 --invert --out cat.txt
```

GUI:

```pwsh
python "ImgToASCII/convert_gui.py"
```

### 5.7. TFTP Tool

```pwsh
# Terminal 1 â€“ start the server on a high, non-privileged port
python "TFTP Tool/cli.py" --port 6969 server data_root

# Terminal 2 â€“ download and upload files with block-size negotiation
python "TFTP Tool/cli.py" --port 6969 get 127.0.0.1 remote.txt local.txt --blksize 2048
python "TFTP Tool/cli.py" --port 6969 put 127.0.0.1 local.txt remote_copy.txt --blksize 1024
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Did you activate the venv and install deps? (`pip list`) |
| Tk windows fail to open | On WSL / headless systems Tk may not be available; run on native desktop. |
| OpenCV import crash | Try reinstall: `pip install --force-reinstall opencv-python` (ensure matching architecture). |
| Pillow fails to load WebP | Install extras: `pip install Pillow[webp]` |
| Plotly map not showing | Ensure you opened the generated HTML in a browser; disable aggressive script blockers. |

---

## 7. Contributing / Extending

1. Keep each tool self-contained (local imports, minimal global state).
2. Prefer adding a focused README inside a subfolder if usage is non-trivial.
3. Add type hints & docstrings for new public functions.
4. For new dependencies: add to root `Practical/requirements.txt` with a brief comment.
5. Avoid breaking existing CLI flagsâ€”add new ones instead of renaming where possible.
6. Run a quick lint / self-test: execute the script with `--help` (should not crash) and one typical command.

### Ideas / Future Improvements

- Split `requirements.txt` into `extras` (e.g., `imageboard`, `vision`, `gui`).
- Add lightweight pytest smoke tests per tool.
- Integrate a `pyproject.toml` for dependency groups & tooling (ruff, black, mypy).
- Provide a launcher script to list and run tools interactively.
- Add Dockerfile for the imageboard (production-like run).
- Implement backlink display in Imageboard (posts that reference an ID).

## 8. License

Refer to the repository root `LICENSE` file. Unless otherwise noted in a subfolder, projects follow that license.

---

## 9. Attribution & Learning Intent

These utilities are educational. Performance and security are *good enough* for learning but may need hardening for production (especially anything involving networking or file uploads). Treat them as starting pointsâ€”fork, explore, and iterate.

Happy hacking! ðŸŽ¯
