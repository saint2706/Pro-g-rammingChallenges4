## Individual Assessments

### Download Manager
- **Correctness:** Comprehensive feature set with multi-threaded range downloads, retries, and checksum verification provides strong coverage of typical downloader requirements. However, resume support only skips work in single-threaded mode; the multi-threaded branch always re-requests every part, so partially downloaded segments are not reused.【F:Practical/Download Manager/dManager.py†L1-L205】【F:Practical/Download Manager/dManager.py†L290-L346】 
- **Efficiency:** Thread pool design is solid but could be improved by detecting already completed byte ranges when resuming to avoid redundant bandwidth usage.【F:Practical/Download Manager/dManager.py†L319-L346】 
- **Readability:** Modular functions (`probe`, `plan_parts`, `download_part`, etc.) and dataclasses keep concerns separated and easy to follow.【F:Practical/Download Manager/dManager.py†L55-L205】 
- **Best Practices:** Argparse-based CLI and explicit exit codes align with idiomatic Python CLI patterns; consider persisting per-part progress metadata to make resume safer in multi-thread mode.【F:Practical/Download Manager/dManager.py†L16-L24】【F:Practical/Download Manager/dManager.py†L290-L346】 

### Producer Consumer
- **Correctness:** Demonstrates canonical producer/consumer flow with queue-backed buffer and sentinel shutdown, but shared `Stats` counters are mutated by multiple threads without synchronization, risking lost increments under contention.【F:Practical/Producer Consumer/pc.py†L1-L193】 
- **Efficiency:** Blocking queue usage keeps throughput reasonable; optional delays make it easy to explore contention scenarios.【F:Practical/Producer Consumer/pc.py†L114-L140】 
- **Readability:** Clear dataclasses, logging helper, and explicit thread orchestration make the flow approachable for learners.【F:Practical/Producer Consumer/pc.py†L30-L193】 
- **Best Practices:** Add locking around shared stats or use thread-safe counters (e.g., `collections.Counter` with locks) to ensure accurate metrics; extend smoke tests for the native variants described alongside the Python demo.【F:Practical/Producer Consumer/README.md†L1-L25】【F:Practical/Producer Consumer/pc.py†L114-L193】 

### IRC Client
- **Correctness:** Async reconnection loop, PING/PONG handling, and command parsing cover core IRC workflows, though input reading relies on `sys.stdin.readline` which can block shutdown on some platforms; consider cancellation-aware async input for better robustness.【F:Practical/IRC Client/irc_client.py†L1-L200】 
- **Efficiency:** Uses asyncio streams and exponential backoff to manage reconnections efficiently.【F:Practical/IRC Client/irc_client.py†L64-L107】 
- **Readability:** Dataclass config plus segmented methods (`_connect`, `_session_loop`, `_listen_to_server`) provide good structure.【F:Practical/IRC Client/irc_client.py†L33-L175】 
- **Best Practices:** Logging integration and TLS support follow idiomatic patterns; adding unit tests for command parsing and using `asyncio.StreamReader.readline` in a background task could improve shutdown semantics.【F:Practical/IRC Client/irc_client.py†L176-L199】 

### Markov Chain Sentence Generator
- **Correctness:** Tokenizer strips boundary punctuation before storing tokens, but start-state detection checks for sentence-ending periods that have already been removed, so sentence boundary detection never seeds additional start states, reducing output diversity.【F:Practical/Markov Chain Sentence Generator/mcsg.py†L67-L124】 
- **Efficiency:** Model building uses dictionaries and deques efficiently for typical corpora.【F:Practical/Markov Chain Sentence Generator/mcsg.py†L55-L138】 
- **Readability:** Dataclasses and modular generator class keep responsibilities clear.【F:Practical/Markov Chain Sentence Generator/mcsg.py†L34-L190】 
- **Best Practices:** CLI and JSON export hooks are idiomatic; adjusting sentence boundary detection (e.g., capture punctuation before stripping or track boundaries separately) would improve correctness.【F:Practical/Markov Chain Sentence Generator/mcsg.py†L70-L97】 

### AutoSave Text Editor
- **Correctness:** Autosave loop hashes content before writing and performs atomic replacements, minimizing data loss risk.【F:Practical/AutoSave Text Editor/aste.py†L1-L112】 
- **Efficiency:** Hash comparison avoids redundant writes and Tk scheduling keeps UI responsive.【F:Practical/AutoSave Text Editor/aste.py†L73-L160】 
- **Readability:** Menu construction, file operations, and status updates are neatly segmented into helper methods.【F:Practical/AutoSave Text Editor/aste.py†L113-L230】 
- **Best Practices:** Docstring lists planned extensions (read-only mode, backups, shortcuts); implementing those and extracting file I/O into a separate service class would further align with SRP.【F:Practical/AutoSave Text Editor/aste.py†L1-L43】 

### Bayesian Filter
- **Correctness:** Wraps scikit-learn’s GaussianNB pipeline with configurable feature subset and metrics reporting, covering standard Naive Bayes flow.【F:Practical/Bayesian Filter/iris.py†L1-L150】 
- **Efficiency:** Relies on vectorized pandas/sklearn operations; optional feature selection avoids unnecessary columns.【F:Practical/Bayesian Filter/iris.py†L51-L119】 
- **Readability:** Dataclasses (`Config`, `Metrics`) and structured functions for load/train/metrics make extension straightforward.【F:Practical/Bayesian Filter/iris.py†L33-L149】 
- **Best Practices:** Error handling and JSON export follow good CLI practices; consider exposing train/test split sizes and dataset validation through unit tests for reproducibility.【F:Practical/Bayesian Filter/iris.py†L120-L214】 

> **Note:** Remaining projects follow similar modernization patterns (dataclass configs, CLI guards, modular logic) as outlined in the Practical README. Focus future review time on the prioritized fixes below.

## Priority Fixes
1. **Markov Chain Sentence Generator** – Restore sentence boundary detection so additional start states are discovered after punctuation stripping; without this, generated text stagnates.【F:Practical/Markov Chain Sentence Generator/mcsg.py†L70-L97】
2. **Download Manager** – Enhance multi-threaded resume to honor existing partial chunks instead of redownloading the entire file when resuming.【F:Practical/Download Manager/dManager.py†L290-L346】
3. **Producer Consumer** – Guard shared statistics mutations with a lock or atomic counters to avoid undercounting in concurrent runs.【F:Practical/Producer Consumer/pc.py†L114-L193】
4. **IRC Client** – Improve stdin handling to respect cancellation, ensuring clean shutdown on EOF or signal without hanging threads.【F:Practical/IRC Client/irc_client.py†L176-L199】
5. **AutoSave Text Editor** – Implement the planned extensions (read-only flag, backup rotation, shortcuts) to close functionality gaps documented in the module header.【F:Practical/AutoSave Text Editor/aste.py†L1-L43】
