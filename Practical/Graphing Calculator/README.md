# Graphing Calculator

This challenge focuses on building interactive graphing tools that plot mathematical expressions. The reference implementation in this repository ships with a Streamlit demo, but the directory is now organized to host multiple solutions implemented with different stacks.

## Solutions

- `streamlit_app.py` – original Streamlit interface backed by `plot_core.py`.
- `solutions/python_cli` – lightweight CLI utility that renders plots to PNG files using Matplotlib.
- `solutions/node_terminal` – Node.js script that draws an ASCII chart directly in the terminal.

Feel free to add more solutions under the `solutions/` folder, following the conventions demonstrated here.
